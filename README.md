## About

![KeyStrokes](https://imgur.com/WubfNFO.png)

KeyStrokes is a Rainmeter skin that displays your keypresses in real-time. It allows you to choose between two display presets and comes with serveral appearance customization options, as the name implies.

## Features

* RGB Chroma Feature
* 2 Display Presets
* Slew Of Customization Options 
* Accelerometer Support

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Rainmeter v4.5 or newer.** Rainmeter can be installed by downloading the `.exe` file [from Rainmeter's official website.](https://www.rainmeter.net/)
- **JaxCore v40005.** JaxCore can be installed by downloading the `.rmskin` file from [JaxCore's official website.](https://jax-core.github.io/)

### Installation

Assuming you successfully downloaded and installed Rainmeter as well as JaxCore, you can now proceed to install Keystrokes by following the steps below.

1. Download and run the `.rmskin` file for **Keystrokes** from the official [JaxCore site](https://jax-core.github.io/) to install **Keystrokes**.
2. Leave the installation settings at their defaults and click Install.
3. When the installation is finished, a startup pop-up should appear. Follow through the pop-up to finish installing **Keystrokes**.

* Note:  If you find that the JaxCore option is red on the startup pop-up, please press the red button and Core will be installed automatically. Perchance this fails, you can manually install Core by downloading the `.rmskin` file from [JaxCore's official website.](https://jax-core.github.io/)

### Customization

Now that you've installed and configured Keystrokes, let's take a look at some of its customization options!

* Layouts:
  - **Movements :** Displays only the movement keys (W,A,S,D, and Spacebar) as well as mouse buttons and the accelerometer. 
  - **Fullboard :** Displays your entire keyboard as well the mouse accelerometer.

  **Note: Mouse Buttons and Mouse Accelerometer can be toggled On or Off when using either preset.**

* Further customization can be done through the **Appearance** tab which also includes the **RBG Chroma** feature.
